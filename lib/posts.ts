    intro: 'An established freelance profile can have real business value: history, trust, context, and access to relevant opportunities. But a profile alone does not create revenue. It needs consistent research, thoughtful proposals, professional conversations, and dependable delivery behind it.',
    sections: [
      { heading: 'Why good accounts go quiet', paragraphs: ['Freelance channels are often underused because one person cannot do everything at once. Finding the right jobs takes time. Proposals require research. Client calls need preparation. Then the actual work still has to be scoped, built, tested, and supported.', 'A delivery partnership closes that operating gap.

A partner should avoid treating every dollar received as spendable cash and ask a qualified tax professional how much to reserve.', 'Never describe team payments as deductions without professional review. A CPA or enrolled agent should determine what is deductible, how the business relationship should be classified, and which forms are required.'] },
